\section{Report}
The users might run into a problem. That is where the \texttt{ReportControl\-ler} comes in to inform the administrators about the problem. At the moment of writing this thesis, there is only one endpoint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\text{[POST]} /api/v1/report} -- Sends the \texttt{ReportModel} acquired from the request body to the system administrators configured in Controller's configuration.
\end{itemize}
