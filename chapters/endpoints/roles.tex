\section{User Roles}
When a user decides to adjust the \texttt{UserRole}s of the reservation requests he has access to, he can use the endpoints implemented in \texttt{UserRoleController}.
The available endpoints include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{/api/v1/reservation\_requests/\{id\}/roles} -- This endpoint manages user roles that are configured for the reservation request specified by the \texttt{id} path parameter. There are two available HTTP methods:
    \begin{description}
        \item \textbf{[GET]} -- Returns all roles (\texttt{ListResponse<UserRoleModel>}) that are configured for specified reservation request.
        \item \textbf{[POST]} -- Creates a new role defined by \texttt{UserRoleModel} acquired from the request body.
    \end{description}
    \item \textbf{[DELETE] /api/v1/reservation\_requests/\{id\}/roles/\{entityId\}} -- Deletes the configured user role specified by \texttt{entityId} path parameter from reservation request specified by \texttt{id} path parameter.
\end{itemize}
