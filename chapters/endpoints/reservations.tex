\section{Reservation Requests}
The following endpoints are the most important since they manage the central part of the Shongo system --- reservation requests.
The available endpoints include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{/api/v1/reservation\_requests} -- Manages the reservation requests. There are two available HTTP methods:
    \begin{description}
        \item \textbf{[GET]} -- Returns all reservation requests (\texttt{ListResponse<Reser\-vationRequestModel>}). However, they can be filtered by many query parameters closely described in \Cref{tab:res}.
        \item \textbf{[POST]} -- Creates a new reservation request defined by \texttt{Reser\-vationRequestCreateModel} acquired from the request body.
    \end{description}
    \item \textbf{/api/v1/reservation\_requests/\{id\}} -- Manages the reservation request specified by \texttt{id} path parameter. There are two available HTTP methods:
    \begin{description}
        \item \textbf{[GET]} -- Returns detailed information about the reservation request (\texttt{ReservationRequestDetailModel}). It contains additional information about the current state of the reservation request, its authorized data (\texttt{RoomAuthorizedData}) holding access pins and aliases, and the history of the reservation request (\texttt{List<ReservationRequestHistoryModel>}) holding information about how the request changed over time.
        \item \textbf{[PATCH]} -- Modifies the reservation request with parameters specified by \texttt{ReservationRequestCreateModel} which is acquired from the request body.
        \item \textbf{[DELETE]} -- Deletes the reservation request.
    \end{description}
    \item \textbf{[POST] /api/v1/reservation\_requests/\{id\}/accept} -- The administrator or resource owner can use this endpoint to accept the reservation request awaiting confirmation, so it becomes ready for allocation and eventually turns into a reservation.
    \item \textbf{[POST] /api/v1/reservation\_requests/\{id\}/reject} -- The administrator or resource owner can use this endpoint to reject the reservation request awaiting confirmation.
    \item \textbf{[POST] /api/v1/reservation\_requests/\{id\}/reject} -- Reverts the modifications of the reservation request.
\end{itemize}
