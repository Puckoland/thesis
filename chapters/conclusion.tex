\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, new functional API was implemented for the Shongo system.
This API fulfills REST principles.
As a result, the new front-end \cite{drobnakm} is able to communicate with Shongo back-end, thus making the original \texttt{shongo-web-client} obsolete.
Moreover, the API makes the Shongo system available for any application or service outside of Shongo system.

The resulting REST API is documented with \texttt{Javadoc} and \hyperref[sec:openapi]{OpenAPI specification} is generated and made available on REST server.
In addition, this specification is added to \hyperref[sec:spring]{Spring UI}, which is also deployed on REST server.

The end.
