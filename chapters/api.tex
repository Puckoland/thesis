\chapter{Final Api} \label{cha:api}
This chapter describes the final REST API implemented for the Shongo system. The complete generated (OpenAPI) documentation is available in \Cref{ape:documentation}.

Most of the list endpoints return data in \texttt{ListResponse<Model>} format. This is done so the pagination is possible for the resources that have many records. The example is shown in \Cref{lst:listresponse}. The \texttt{start} attribute represents the index of the first record in the \texttt{items} list. Finally, the \texttt{count} attribute informs the receiver about how many records are actually available in total.
These endpoints also accept the \texttt{start} and \texttt{count} query parameters that set the requested \emph{start} and \emph{number} of items in \texttt{ListResponse}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption=ListResponse, label=lst:listresponse]
{
    start: 0,
    count: 2,
    items: [
        {
            id: 1,
            name: "My room"
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            name: "Your room"
        }
    ]
}
\end{lstlisting}
