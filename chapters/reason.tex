\chapter{What to change and why}

% Nowadays, most of big systems run as micro-services that communicate together but can work as a single part.
% This opens door to containerization which makes the deployment so much easier.

Second reason is user interface \Cref{webclient}. Web MVC is not as powerful as today's JavaScript frameworks like Angular or React.
So it become the goal of another thesis. \cite{drobnakm}
But since until now the whole communication of system was via Spring Framework in Java some new API has to be created.

As we can see on \Cref{fig:architecture_new}, Web Client component has been moved out of the Shongo system and is developed and maintained separately at \href{https://github.com/shongo/shongo-frontend}{new Github repository}. This part has been done in another thesis \cite{drobnakm}.
Additionally it is communicating with Controller via REST API instead of XML-RPC. The implementation of this REST API is the subject of this thesis.

\section{API options}
Today there are 3 general approaches for such API.
\subsection{GraphQL}
\subsection{RPC}
\subsection{REST API}
